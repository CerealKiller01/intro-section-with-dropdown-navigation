## Overview
Thanks for visiting this repository. I'm new doing this but every day I try and I like to keep learning.
This small page is made with effort and dedication based on the knowledge I have.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5


### What I learned
In this practice I have learned to implement new Bootstrap 5 concepts and also to combine it with CSS.


### Continued development

For future projects I would like to improve the use of Bootstrap 5 a lot, since it is still a bit complicated to use. But with effort and dedication anything is possible.
